HiCEnterprise predicts long-range interactions between regions/domains based on Hi-C maps.

\section{What is in the package?}
HiCEnterprise takes a list of regions/domains and searches for their significant interactions on given Hi-C maps.
Package consists of two types of analyses: regions and domains.

\subsection{Types of analyses}

\subsubsection{Regions}
This part of the package is an implementation of the method for identification of long-range interacting regions and
creating interaction profiles based on Hi-C data as introduced by (Won et al. 2016).

More in~\ref{regions}.

\subsubsection{Domains}
In the domain part of the package we implemented the method for prediction of long-range interactions between TADs
(Topologically Associating Domains) as presented by (Niskanen et al. n.d.).

More in~\ref{domains}.

\section{Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://www.python.org}{Python} version 2.7 or 3.5/6
\item required python packages are provided in requirements.txt file.
\item if you want to plot through R, you need have R installed with needed packages.

\end{itemize}

\section{Basic usage}

\begin{lstlisting}
HiCEnterprise type options
\end{lstlisting}


'type' can be either regions or domains. Other options are type dependent.

If you want to see the list of available arguments with short explanations type either \\
\lstinline{HiCEnterprise regions --help}
or \lstinline{HiCEnterprise domains --help}. Full specifications for each argument can be found in the documentation
(\ref{regions} and~\ref{domains})

\subsection{Installation}

\begin{lstlisting}
python setup.py install
\end{lstlisting}


You may need administrative privileges to do this.

\subsubsection{Testing the installation}

To test if the scripts behave in a way they should be find the main HiCEnterprise directory and run:

\begin{lstlisting}
python setup.py test
\end{lstlisting}

pytest package is needed for running the test framework.


\subsection{Examples}

We provided some example files (used for testing too) with which you can learn to use the program.
Here you can see two example runs:

\subsubsection{Regions}

\begin{lstlisting}
HiCEnterprise regions regions_options
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Domains}

\begin{lstlisting}
HiCEnterprise domains domains_options
\end{lstlisting}


Additional examples and specifications for each argument can be found in the documentation for a specific type
(\ref{regions} and~\ref{domains}).
